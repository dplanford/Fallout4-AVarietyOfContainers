# Fallout4-AVarietyOfContainers
A Fallout 4 mod that retextures the game's containers. For example, instead of the single tan suitcase in vanilla, you will now see 23 variations!

If you add the mod "Settlement Menu Manager", you can also craft all the new containers in the Workshop.

This initial import is version 2.4 of our mod... older versions can be found at nexusmods.com.

Place the 3 files in your Fallout 4 Data directory, and add the .esp file to your mod list.

The "AVOC DLC Patch.esp" file fixes some pre-combined meshes issues if you are using the Far Harbor or Nuka Cola World DLCs.
